      Won my first Battleship game. It was awesome. Only lost two ships. THIS IS THE BEST SHIP FORMATION, NO ONE COULD BEAT ME ALL NIGHT!  <br>
        <br>
      I'll save it just in case  <br>
        <br>
      And how simple it turned out to be, it was as if the solution had always been on my forehead. I just had to birth the idea from it.  <br>
